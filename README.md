Assignment 3 literature review

### Question
I wanted to focus my question within the context of game development. Specifically, I am curious what makes a programming language viable or not viable for games? In general, the language needs to be high level to accomodate for developer productivity and ease of use, as well as performant, to accomodate complex frame updates that involve scripts, physics, sound, AI, etc.... To what degree do different programming languages accomodate these needs, and how is that reflected in development? What characteristics of programming languages are most important to support performant gameplay?

### What makes a programming language viable or not viable for game development?
GPT had a lot to say about what makes a programming viable or not viable for game development. Much of its answer lay outside the scope of my direct line of questioning, such as community & tools, learning curve, and suitability for different game genres. It also spoke on game engine support & language integration, which I believe is not as much of any issue given the availability of plugins to support non-native languages. I was most interested in what it had to say about performance requirements and cross-platform compatability.
