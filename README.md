Assignment 3 literature review

### Question
I wanted to focus my question within the context of game development. Specifically, I am curious about what makes a programming language viable or not viable for games. In general, the language needs to be high level to accommodate for developer productivity and ease of use, as well as performant to accommodate complex frame updates that involve scripts, physics, sound, AI, etc... To what degree do different programming languages accommodate these needs, and how is that reflected in the development process? What is the history of programming languages within the scope of game development?

## My Conversation with Chat GPT-4o (Paid version)
### What makes a programming language viable or not viable for game development?
GPT had a lot to say about what makes a programming language viable or not viable for game development. Much of its answer lay outside the scope of my direct line of questioning, such as community & tools, learning curve, and suitability for different game genres. It also spoke on game engine support & language integration, which I wasn't as interested in given the availability of plugins to support non-native languages. I was most interested in what it had to say about performance requirements and platform compatibility.

    1. Performance
    - Real-time computation: Games, especially 3D or real-time ones, require fast execution to handle physics calculations, rendering, and AI. Languages like C++ are popular in game development because of their ability to offer low-level memory management and performance optimizations.
    - Multithreading: Modern games often require parallel processing for tasks like rendering, physics, AI, and networking. Languages with strong multithreading capabilities are more suited for handling these needs efficiently.
    
    2. Memory Management
    - Manual vs. Automatic Memory Management: Languages that offer fine-grained control over memory allocation (like C++ and C) are preferred for performance-critical parts of a game (e.g., large game worlds, simulations). On the other hand, languages with garbage collection (e.g., Java, C#) may introduce performance issues like garbage collection pauses, though these issues have been mitigated in many cases.
    - Memory Efficiency: Games need to be optimized for a variety of devices (consoles, PCs, mobile), making memory efficiency critical. Languages that give developers control over memory allocation are often favored in this context.
    
    3. Platform Compatibility
    - Cross-platform development: Many games need to be developed for multiple platforms (PC, consoles, mobile). Languages that are supported by game engines with multi-platform capabilities (like C# in Unity or C++ in Unreal Engine) are highly viable.
    - Toolchain support: The programming language should integrate well with development tools (e.g., game engines, debuggers, profiling tools) to ensure smooth game creation and deployment across different platforms.
    
    5. Development Speed and Ease of Use
    - High-level vs. Low-level programming: High-level languages like Python are easier and faster to write but might not provide the required performance for complex games. Low-level languages like C++ offer more control but can increase development time due to complexity.
    - Readability and Maintainability: Easier-to-read languages (like C#) can reduce development time and make it easier for teams to collaborate, maintain, and scale the codebase.

    7. Networking and Multiplayer Support
    - Multiplayer and networking capabilities: Modern games often include online multiplayer. A viable language must have robust support for networking libraries or features to handle server-client architectures, synchronization, and real-time communication.
    - Latency and Packet Management: Languages that allow efficient handling of network latency and packet management, like C++, are often preferred for real-time multiplayer games.

From this answer, it seems like the viability of the language greatly reflects the needs and scope of the game. Low-level languages, such as C++, are more suitable for very complex titles, such as AAA titles, where script behavior can be heavily monitored and manipulated. However, low-level languages are less readable and can impinge on the development process. The target platform needs to be considered. Consoles like Xbox and PlayStation are only compatible with C, C++, and C#.[^1]

#### Followup: Specifically, what characteristics of C++ make it so viable for game development?
I thought that GPT's answer was a convincing argument for the superiority of C++ over other development languages. I was curious as to what specifically makes it so viable.

    1. High Performance
    - Low-level Memory Control: C++ allows developers to manage memory manually through features like dynamic memory allocation and direct memory access (pointers). This level of control is crucial in games, where optimizing memory usage can significantly impact performance, especially in large, complex environments.
    - Optimized for Speed: C++ is compiled directly to machine code, which ensures that games can run as efficiently as possible without the overhead seen in interpreted or higher-level languages. This performance is vital for games requiring real-time rendering, physics simulations, and AI.
    
    3. Efficient Multithreading and Concurrency
    - Multithreading Support: Games often rely on multiple threads to perform different tasks simultaneously, such as handling physics, AI, and rendering on separate threads. C++ offers efficient multithreading capabilities via libraries like the C++ Standard Library, Boost, and platform-specific APIs. This makes it easier to optimize games for modern multi-core processors.
    - Concurrency: C++ provides control over thread management and synchronization primitives, which allows game developers to take full advantage of parallel processing, crucial for tasks like physics simulations and real-time rendering.
    
    5. Fine-grained Control Over Hardware
    - Close-to-Hardware Access: C++ allows developers to work closer to the hardware than higher-level languages, which is especially important in performance-critical applications like games. It supports direct interaction with the GPU for rendering, the CPU for processing, and other system resources (like input devices, sound cards, and storage).
    - Optimization: The ability to write platform-specific, low-level optimizations in C++ is one of the reasons it's preferred for developing AAA games. Developers can fine-tune their code to maximize hardware capabilities, whether itâ€™s squeezing out performance on a console or optimizing for high-end gaming PCs.
    
    6. Memory Efficiency and Deterministic Behavior
    - Manual Memory Management: C++ gives developers precise control over memory allocation, which allows for more efficient use of system resources. This is critical in large open-world games, where memory use needs to be tightly controlled to prevent performance drops or crashes.
    - No Garbage Collection: Unlike languages with garbage collection (like C# or Java), C++ does not rely on automated memory management. This avoids the unpredictable pauses that can occur when the garbage collector runs, which could be detrimental in real-time applications like games.

The close-to-hardware access provided with C++ allows for optimized performance-critical systems, such as rendering (GPU) and input (peripherals). Since C++ is compiled directly into machine code, the overhead costs of interpreted or higher-level languages can be avoided, leading to very fast performance. Direct control over garbage collection and memory management provides precise control over memory allocation. This helps the program utilize resources efficiently. 

### To what degree do different programming languages accommodate the needs for ease-of-use and performance, and how is that reflected in the development process?
GPT's answer spoke directly about low-level vs mid-level vs high-level languages, and the manner in which each paradigm accommodates the above-mentioned needs. As mentioned in my previous question, low-level languages provide close-to-hardware access and precise control over various important systems. Game systems such as physics simulations and rendering systems are critically performance dependent, and are computationally intensive tasks when performed every frame. This access allows developers to fine-tune scripts to optimize for specific platforms and hardware requirements. This is especially important for a console because its hardware does not get upgraded (or changed, in general) over its lifetime. This low-level access is offset by accessibility. These languages require deep understanding of memory management, pointers, etc... These languages also necessitate handling memory leak and buffer overflow events. While this would not dissuade the use of low-level languages for proficient developers, the popularity of mid and high-level languages over low-level ones reflects this lack of popular accessibility. 
Mid-level languages, such as C# and Java, are very popular languages used in game development. The Unity game engine (the engine I personally use) uses C# natively. While these languages may not match the raw speed of low-level languages, they are often compiled to intermediate bytecode by the engine, which runs optimally on virtual machines. These languages utilize just-in-time compilation, which optimizes performance at runtime. This is very important in performance-heavy games, because JIT will analyze where the benefits of compilation outweigh the cost of compilation, which can have a profound effect on frame-dependent behaviors. These languages allow for faster development due to readability and abstraction capabilities, among other benefits.
High-level languages are very accessible and generally performant with systems that are not performance-critical. Systems such as rendering and physics simulations perform much slower due to the fact that they are typically interpreted languages or run in virtual machines. 

GPT concluded this question by saying:

    - High Performance, Lower Ease-of-Use: Languages like C++ provide unparalleled performance, making them essential for real-time games and AAA development, but require skilled developers due to their complexity and the need for manual memory management.
    - Balanced Performance and Ease-of-Use: Mid-level languages like C# and Java offer managed memory, robust libraries, and more developer-friendly environments while still delivering reasonable performance. They are popular in engines like Unity and for mobile games.
    - Ease-of-Use, Lower Performance: High-level and scripting languages like Python, Lua, and UnrealScript favor ease-of-use, enabling rapid development and iteration but are typically not suited for performance-critical systems. These are ideal for less intensive tasks like scripting game mechanics or prototyping.
